    <h1>The Amazing Git Story</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a boy named Git. His friends were always misplacing their old toys, but Git, he still had every toy he ever laid eyes on.</p>
    <p>There was also a boy named Grit, he didn't know how to use Git, He tried for a while, and then with a smile, he blew his fucking brains out! ^_^</p>
    <p>The next day, a novice Git'r tried to add to a story on Git, he ran into a 403 because he didn't realized he was trying to push to the actual repo and not his copy. He then quit Git as  never forgave Jessie again</p>
    <p>There ain't no rules to this one man once said</p>
